# dw-camkes-manifests

Was using camkes & seL4 for a project. seL4 set-up failed.

We had to revert musllibc.git to previous revision as the main branch at the time was broken in some way.

It seems that the current branch has addressed this issue.

*Keeping this up until I make sure the up-to-date branch works*
